# vimrc

Hi everyone! This is my vimrc configration file used for vim editor.

1. the .vimrc shows my vimrc configurations.

2. the .vimogen_repos file lists all the plugins that I used.

You can visit my blog [here](https://blog.csdn.net/xuyangcao123/article/details/105493694) to learn more details about these plugins.
